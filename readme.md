UCS_Build Script
Name: UCS_Build_Script.ps1
Author: Chris Nickl
Created: 7/30/2013

Description:
This script grabs its' varables from the custom excel sheet and then builds a custom UCS Build.

For now this script builds a general configuration type.

Version 2 will be built to my UCS Best-Practices.

Version 3 will allow for a WAY more customized build.

This script will finally be used for a fully scripted FlexPod build, including switches, storage, compute and even basic VMware.
